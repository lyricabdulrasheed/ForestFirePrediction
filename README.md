Wildfire Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood and severity of wildfires based on various environmental factors.

Key Features:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect and clean historical wildfire data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, fuel moisture, vegetation type, slope, and region.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features like fire weather indices to improve model performance.
Model Selection and Training: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Deploy the model as a web application or API to provide real-time wildfire risk predictions.
Ethical Considerations:

Bias Mitigation: Ensure the model is trained on diverse data to avoid bias.
Fairness: Consider the potential impact of predictions on different regions and communities.
Transparency: Clearly communicate the model's limitations and uncertainties.
Privacy: Protect the privacy of individuals and communities affected by wildfires.
By developing a robust and ethical wildfire prediction model, we can help improve early warning systems, resource allocation, and overall wildfire management.
